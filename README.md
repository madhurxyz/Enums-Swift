#Enums
Enums are a unique way to structure data models in swift. They allow you to define a group of related values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way within your code. I did these challenges to learn Enums and how to structure a data model in an iOS app that follows MVC.

##How it Works
1. There are three different categories of challenges:
  * Control Flow with Enums
  * Enums with Raw values
  * Enums with Associated values
2. Each category has 3 challenges.
3. The first category is an introduction to setting up enums in swift.
4. The second category shows how to give enums raw values and pass them as arguments.
5. The third category shows how to deal with associated values and return them.
