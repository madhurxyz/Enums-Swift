 ### Challenges
 
 1. Model a type called `Box` that is either empty or contains exactly one `Thing`. `Thing` looks as follows:
 ```
 class Thing {
   let name: String
 
   init(name: String) {
     self.name = name
   }
 }
 ```
 2. Create an empty `Box`
 3. Create three different `Box`es, each should contain one item of the following: `Soccer Ball`, `Phone`, `Chocolate`
 4. Write a function that takes a `Box` as an argument and returns a `String` indicating what that `Box` contains.
 5. Make the `Box` _generic_ so that it can contain an object of any type, not just `Thing`.

class Thing {

    init(name: String){
        self.name = name
    }
